# NA_imputation

This R script was produced in the context of the METEOR (Modules Experiment-ThEOry-Research) "Large-scale classification of high-dimensional data" of the MAUCA (Master track in Astrophysics in Université Côte d'Azur). We work with an asteroid spectra dataset of 53 columns and 6055 rows, with some spectra only in the visible domain, some only in the near-infrared, and some in both domains. The goal was to impute the missing values (NA) in our dataset in order to have a complete dataset that would be easier to apply clustering methods to. We tried to impute data while accounting for NA patterns (NA distribution in a specific wavelength domain) or not. We compared three imputation methods: imputation by the mean, low-rank method (SoftImpute), random forests (missForest).
